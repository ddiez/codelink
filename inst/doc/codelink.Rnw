\section{Introduction}

Codelink\textsuperscript{\textsc{tm}} is a platform for the analysis of gene
expression on biological samples using short (30 base long) oligonucleotide
probes.  There is a proprietary software for reading scanned images, spot
intensity quantization and some diagnostics.  Quality flags (Table
\ref{tab:Flag}) are assigned to the spot based on signal to noise ratio (SNR)
computation (Eq: \ref{eq:SNR}) and other morphological characteristics as
irregular shape of the spots, saturation of the signal or manufacturer spots
removed. The results can be exported in many formats as XML, Excel, plain text,
etc. This library allows to read Codelink plain text exported data into R
\cite{r} for analysis of gene expression with any of the available tools in
R+Bioconductor\cite{BIOC}. A new class is defined for convenient storing
Codelink data as exprSet class is not convenient for this purpose.

\section{Reading data}

Currently only data exported as plain text from Codelink software can be used.
The Codelink text format can have arbitrary columns and header fields so
depending of what you have exported you can read it or not. The suggestion is
that you put on the files Spot\_mean and Bkgd\_median values so you can do
background correction and normalization in R. If you put Raw\_intensity or
Normalized\_intensity columns then you can also read it directly and avoid
background correction and/or normalization but this is not recommended. To read
some Codelink files you do:

\begin{Sinput}

> library(codelink)
> files <- list.files(pattern="TXT")
> data <- readCodelink(files)

\end{Sinput}

This suppose that your files have the extension ``TXT'' (uppercase)
and they are in your working directory. The function emph{readCodelink()}
returns and object of class ``Codelink'':

<<data>>=

library(codelink)

data(codelink.example)

codelink.example

@

\begin{itemize}
\item Product\_name: Type of chip loaded.
\item Sample\_name: Character vector of sample names.
\item File\_name: Character vector of file names.
\item Probe\_name: Character vector of probe names (Codelink identifiers).
\item Probe\_type: Character vector with probe type information.
\item Log\_transformed: Logical, TRUE if data is log2 transformed.
\item Quality\_flag: Matrix of Codelink Flags.
\item Spot\_mean: Matrix with mean of signal intensity values.
\item Bkgd\_median: Matrix with median of background intensity values.
\item Raw\_intensity: Matrix with intensity values after background correction.
\item Normalized\_intensity: Matrix with intensity values after normalization.
\item SNR: Matrix with SNR values.
\item CV: Numeric vector with coefficient of variation after merging arrays.
\end{itemize}

By default, all spots flagged with M, I, and S flags are set to NA. This can be
changed with the flag argument in readCodelink(). The flag argument is a list
that can contain a valid flag identifier and a value for that flag. For
example, if you want to set all M flagged spots to 0.01 and let other spot
untouched you do:

\begin{Sinput}

> data <- readCodelink(files, flag=list(M=0.01) )

\end{Sinput}

\section{Background correction}

Spot\_mean intensity values can be processed into Raw\_intensity through
background correction:

\begin{Sinput}

> data <- bkgdCorrect(data, method="half")

\end{Sinput}

The default method used is based on the \emph{half} method from \emph{limma} \cite{limma} package. Median background intensity (Bkgd\_median) is subtracted
from mean spot intensity (Spot\_mean) and if the result is less than
0.5 then it is set to 0.5 to ensure no negative numbers are obtained.


\section{Normalization}

Normalization of Raw\_intensity values are done with the wrapper function
normalize(). The default method is \emph{quantile} normalization
that in fact call \emph{normalizeQuantiles()} from \emph{limma} package
(that allows for NAs). There is also the possibility to use a modified
version of cyclic loess from affy \cite{affy} package that also allows NA
values.

\begin{Sinput}

> data <- normalize(data, method="quantile")

\end{Sinput}

By default, normalize() return log2 intensity values.  This could be
changed setting the parameter log.it to FALSE.


\section{Plotting}

There are some plotting functions available that can use directly the
Codelink objects. These are functions for producing MA plots
(plotMA()), scatterplots (plotCorrelation()) and density
plots (plotDensities()).  All functions use the available intensity
value (i.e.  Spot\_mean, Raw\_intensity or Normalized\_intensity) to make the
plot.

The function plotMA() can highlight spots based on Probe\_type values
(by default) or SNR values setting the argument label. It requires array1 and
array2 arguments and compute M and A values based on equations \ref{eq:M} and
\ref{eq:A}.

\begin{center}

<<plotMA, fig=TRUE>>=

plotMA(codelink.example, legend.x="topright")

@
\end{center}

\begin{equation}
M=Array2-Array1
\label{eq:M}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
A=\frac{Array2+Array1}{2}
\label{eq:A}
\end{equation}

The function plotDensities() plot the density of intensity values of
all arrays. If the subset argument is supplied it can use only a subset of the arrays in the Codelink object.

\begin{center}
<<plotDensity, fig=TRUE>>=

plotDensities(codelink.example)

@
\end{center}

\section{Miscellaneus}

There are also some miscellaneous functions used in some analysis that could be
useful for someone.

\subsection{Using weights}

The createWeights() function creates a matrix of weights based on Probe\_type 
labels to be used, for example, in fitting a linear model with limma 
\cite{limma}.

<<createWeights>>=

w <- createWeights(codelink.example, type=list(FIDUCIAL=0.01, NEGATIVE=0.1))

w[1:10,]

@

\subsection{Merging arrays}

In case you want to merge array intensities the mergeArray() function help on 
this task. It computes the mean of Normalized\_intensity values on arrays of 
the same class. The grouping is done by means of the 'class' argument 
(numerical vector of classes). New sample names should be assigned to 
Sample\_name slot with the 'names' argument. The function also returns the 
coefficient of variation in the 'CV' slot. The distribution of coefficients of 
variations can be checked with the function plotCV().

\begin{Sinput}

> data <- mergeArray(data, group=c(1,1,2,2),
+ names=c("A","B"))

> plotCV(data)

\end{Sinput}
